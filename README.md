## MDMI Maps
The MDMI Map Repository contains published maps for industry standard healthcare exchange standards, with the current focus on HL7 standards. For each standard, different maps are provided based on different versions of the standard and different content specifications. For example different profiles in FHIR, different documents in CDA, and different message types in V2. It is possible to develop an MDMI Map and provide it as an open source map.

New and updated maps are continually added to the repository.
